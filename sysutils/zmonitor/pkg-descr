ZMonitor is a lightweight Python-based utility designed for FreeBSD systems to
monitor ZFS pool health and performance metrics in real time.

It periodically collects and transmits system and ZFS statistics — including
CPU usage, memory utilization, read/write throughput, and disk error counts —
to a serial-connected display or external controller. The tool is also capable
of running in a configurable "dry run" mode, which prints metrics to standard
output instead of writing to the serial interface, making it ideal for testing
and debugging.

ZMonitor automatically detects and handles serial device attach/detach events
(e.g. /dev/cuaU0), reads configuration from
/usr/local/etc/zmonitor.conf, and gracefully shuts down on system signals.
