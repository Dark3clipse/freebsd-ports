list-disks is a lightweight FreeBSD shell utility that enumerates all system disks
with detailed information, including:

  • Device name, serial number, and model
  • Disk capacity and partition table type
  • Partition list and associated GPT labels
  • ZFS pool membership (mapped via GPT or partition device)

It integrates with the FreeBSD base tools (gpart, glabel, zpool, diskinfo)
and smartmontools to provide a comprehensive disk overview suitable for
administration scripts, diagnostics, or inventory reporting.

The utility produces neatly aligned, human-readable tabular output and
requires no configuration.
