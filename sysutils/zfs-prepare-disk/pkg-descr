zfs-prepare-disk: A utility to safely prepare disks for ZFS on FreeBSD

zfs-prepare-disk is a command-line utility designed to simplify the
preparation of disks for use with ZFS. It automates GPT partitioning
and creation of a freebsd-zfs partition while providing safety checks
and a dry-run mode to prevent accidental data loss.

Features:
  * Automatically generates a unique GPT label for each disk.
  * Supports a dry-run mode for testing without making changes.
  * Prompts the user for confirmation before destructive actions.
  * Uses FreeBSD base utilities (gpart, dd) for disk operations.
  * Easy to integrate into scripts or automated setups.
